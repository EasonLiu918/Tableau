# Global Electric Vehicle Development Dashboard  

## Overview  
This interactive Tableau dashboard visualises the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide.  
Built on **IEA Global EV Data 2024**, it tracks annual sales, BEV/PHEV market shares and adoption rates (2010 – 2023), with forecast lines to hint at future growth. By combining filters, parameters and responsive charts, the workbook helps policymakers, industry analysts and researchers understand the pace and pattern of EV adoption across 50-plus economies.

## Key Insights  
- **Accelerating growth** – global EV sales curve steepens post-2020, led by China, EU and the US.  
- **Diverging powertrains** – BEV share overtakes PHEV in most mature markets after 2018.  
- **Policy impact visible** – spikes coincide with subsidy launches or tightening emission targets.  

---

## Key Takeaways  
1. **Incentives matter** – sustained subsidies correlate with higher BEV penetration.  
2. **Infrastructure drives adoption** – regions with dense charging networks show faster sales growth.  
3. **Market timing differs** – emerging economies follow a delayed but steeper adoption path once infrastructure is in place.  

---

## Strategic Recommendations  
- **Benchmark incentives**: replicate policies of high-growth countries to accelerate local adoption.  
- **Invest in charging**: prioritise fast-charger rollout where EV share lags infrastructure growth.  
- **Plan production**: OEMs should align capacity with forecasted CAGR per region to avoid supply bottlenecks.
