## Dataset  
| Size | 3 000 + tickets |
| ---- | --------------- |
| Key fields | *Date*, *Country*, *Product Group*, *Support Level*, *Priority*, *SLA Status* |
| Cleaning | Dropped incomplete survey columns; retained fully populated operational data |

## Dashboard Highlights  
| Worksheet | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Monthly Ticket Trend (Line)** | Track workload over time |
| **Priority vs Selected Group (H-Bar)** | Compare ticket counts by priority within chosen product/support group |
| **Priority Distribution by Product (Stacked Bar)** | See which products draw higher-priority tickets |
| **SLA Compliance (Pie)** | Share of tickets resolved within SLA |  

---

## Key Insights  
- **Workload seasonality** — certain months show spikes, indicating release cycles or promotion periods.  
- **Priority imbalance** — specific product lines generate a higher share of critical tickets.  
- **SLA gaps** — compliance falls below target when workload surges, suggesting capacity issues.
---

## Key Takeaways  
1. **Staffing adjustments** during peak months can stabilise SLA performance.  
2. **Targeted training** for teams handling high-priority products boosts first-contact resolution.  
3. **Workflow review** is needed where low-priority tickets consume disproportionate effort.  

---

## Strategic Recommendations  
- **Forecast staffing** with the monthly trend to pre-empt backlogs.  
- **Automate low-priority triage** to free experts for critical cases.  
- **Monitor SLA pie** weekly; trigger alerts when compliance < 95 %.
