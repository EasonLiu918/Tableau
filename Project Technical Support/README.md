## 💡 Key Takeaways  
1. **Staffing adjustments** during peak months can stabilise SLA performance.  
2. **Targeted training** for teams handling high-priority products boosts first-contact resolution.

- **Automate low-priority triage** to free experts for critical cases.  
- **Monitor SLA pie** weekly; trigger alerts when compliance < 95 %.
